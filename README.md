# Yfiance_portfolio
This Phyton code reads portfolio from .xlsx portfolio (Python_BKR_WISHLIST.xlsx), modifies it into Pandas DataFrame (delets some columns with trash data)
and then updates it with actual info on stocks - extracts prices and technological sector using yFinance (Yahoo finance). 
It also calculates how much money is invested in different industries and shows the pie charts for illustration.
